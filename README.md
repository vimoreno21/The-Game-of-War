# The-Game-of-War
Linked Lists Card game (in C)

       This project involved recreating the card game called "War".
       
       For those who are not familiar with this game, there are two players total that start with half the deck each. Then, they place down their first card without looking and whoever has the higher card, wins both cards. If both players place the same card down, the war scenario happens. The war scenario is when each player places 2 cards down and the second card is the card they compare. This scenario continues until both cards are not equal. The whole game ends when a player runs out of cards. 
			 
      This program had many challenges, like dealing the deck shuffled and putting the cards back into linked lists in the correct order so there were no infinite games. And the biggest challenge was creating a war scenario than could withstand many loops.
